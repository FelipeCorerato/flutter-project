============

The main idea is to work with the Flutter framework, but here are also some details of the APIs.
As the most of hybrid mobile development framework, Flutter uses a layer "anatomy".

### Framework
The code, while you're developing, is just interpreted by Flutter. When you compile the final version of the app, all the file is executed directly by the device's hardware so then it improves high performance.
